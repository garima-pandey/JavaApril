Creating first program in java

- Every java program start with class
- Class name should start with capital letter
- class name should be same as file name
- class name starts with either aplhabet or special symbol(_, $)

javac: java compiler
java(JRE): Run the java code

main method:

- main is a entry point in every java program
- without main java will compile the code and convert it into byte code. 
But it cannot execute the code or interpret the code

why main is public?

- JRE uses main
- Java command trigger the JRE
- JRE load your class in the memory
- JRE is looking for main
- JRE is outside from our directory/folder/package and outside the package things can access

Why main is static?

- static things are loaded into memory when class is loaded

Why main is void?

- main is void in nature
- main is entry point so there is no need to return anything


Main arguments - String[] args

- main has command line arguments

Command Line Arguments:

- we can make our own commands
- we can pass any number of arguments, that's why it is array
- All arguments are pass to main in form of array of string

What is String?

- String is collection of characters
- String internally is a char[]
- String is a predefined class in java as it is in capital letter

What is System.out.println("Hello World")?

- println(): print in new line, println comes from out object
- out: out is an predefined object, which belongs to PrintStream class
- System is a predefined class used for input, output, and error
e.g: System.in, System.out, System.err

println vs print

- println: print in new line
- print: here cursor remains at the end of the text
