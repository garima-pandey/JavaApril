Java 

- WORA: Write once run anywhere
- Platform independent
- It is a portable
- It is OOPS

Platform = o/s + hardware

Java Working / Why Java?

Source Code				--------->						Binary Languge (2 - 0, 1)
 																or
english(.c, .cpp)		Compile/Translate				Machine Language or Native Code

not platfrom independent 
language

source code (.java)	---------> Byte Code(.class) (intermediate code)--------> 	Binary/machine/native	
						compiler												Interpreter(JRE)


JRE: Java Runtime Environment
JDK: Java Development Kit

binary - 2, (0, 1)

computer system ----> Electronic Device -----> current flow (1) ----> No current flow (0)

Binary language


byte code ---> it is not a source code and not a machine code. it is intermediate code. 
byte code only readable by JRE (interpreter)

JRE: JRE read byte code and convert it into machine code
