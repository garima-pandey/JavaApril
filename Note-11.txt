String Handling:

What is String?

String internally char[]
e.g: String name = "Amit";
char name[] = {'A', 'm', 'i', 't'};
String is a predefine class in Java
It is also treat like a Data type
String is a final class, so you can't inherit

String Objects are created in 2 ways
1. String Literal Style
e.g: String name = "Ram";

2. String Object Style
e.g: String name = new String("Ram");

String use String Pool
String Objects are immutable
- String doesn't change existing or original objects, it can create new memory or object all the time.

String buffer is mutuble that means it doesn't create new objects or memory.
