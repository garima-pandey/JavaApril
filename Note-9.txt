What is Package?

Package is a folder behind the scene.
Package is a collection of classes, interfaces
We divide a Big Project into small-2 packages
So we can group the similar nature code in same kind of package

e.g: user package: Login , Register, Password Change, Account delete

Class Relationship: Inheritance

- Communicate b/w two classes

1. IS A Relationship

BMW is a car
Dog is a animal

2. HAS A Relationship

BMW has a driver
Dog has a bone


In Development:

One class one file
If your class is public so class name be same as file name
So in one file we can have n non public classes
If one file (X.java) has 3 classes e.g:

class X{} class Y{} class Z{}
After compile it will create 3 byte codes
X.class, Y.class, Z.class

Inheritance: Parent Child Relationship
by using extends keyword
Benefits:
Code Reuse

Overriding:
When parent feature is outdated so we override the parent feature in a child class.
Overriding hide the parent feature

1. Must be inheritance
2. Method Signature must be same
void roi(), same child has void roi()
