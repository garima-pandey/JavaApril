OOAD- Object Oriented Analysis and Design
- OOAD provides SOLID principle

1. Duplicacy in program
Solution:

SOLID
D: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Copy paste alternative create a function and call it.


2. Security of the code

- Data Security

Encapsulation - Wrap methods and member variables into a single unit 
is called a class.

Data Hiding - Good Encapsulation

- make member variables private

Good Encapsulation: Data Hiding + Encapsulation

#By default scope is default

4 types of scopes in java

- private: with in the class
- public: Global, access on any package
- default: (not keywprd just concept) - scope with in the package
- protected: with in the package but i can access also outside the package 
using inheritance

This:

- this keyword holds current object's address / reference
- this keyword is optional to write, it is implicitly work itself
