2 major types of programming:

- Procedural - functions - Divide a problem into functions
- OOPS - Wrap all the variables and functions into a single unit

Why OOPS?

In C++, Java Programming

class A {

int x, y;

add()
{}

sub()
{}

div()
{}

mul()
{}

}

class B {

sin()
{
	double x;
}

}

Divide a big problem into classes

OOPS features:

object - real world entity
e.g: car, fan, laptop etc
e.g: amit, ram, shyam, rushil

class/category: collection of similar objects
