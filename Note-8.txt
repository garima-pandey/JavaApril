Constructor:

Q1. Need to initialise the member variable when object is construct.
Ans: We need constructor for this.

-Constructor is call when you create an object.
-So constructor will initialise the member variables
-Constructor name is same as class name
-Constructor never return anything
-It is called only once
-One class can have multiple constructors, so this thing called constructor overloading
-Every class by default have default constructor
-So if you create any other constructor the default constructor is killed


Solution: to use default and parametrized constructor at a time

When we need multiple constructor calls in a single call.
Ans: We need constructor chaining for this.
this keyword also use for constructor chainning.
